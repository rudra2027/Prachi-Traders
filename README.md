 You are heartly advised to create Node_modules  as larger files are yet hard to upload
 I have purposely used react so feel fre to create react app and use  the source code-src.
 to run server - npm run dev
 to run client- cd client -> npm start OR npm run client
 localhost:5000 for json server
 localhost:3000 for react client ui
